Known bugs:
-----------
 + (Fixed in 0.5) Plugin does not work when running on Java 6 (JDK 6.0)
 + (Fixed in 0.5) Code Outline panel is not always rendered when open file or tab
 + (Fixed in 0.5) Exceptions when pointing to not existing place in code
 + (Fixed in 0.5) Not current panel opened if not last tab selected when opening project
 + (Not a bug) Resizing Code Outline panel consume a lot of CPU cause repainted every tick.
   Repainting code is not regenerating img every scrollable area changed event occurred, but
   when resizing involves changes in visible empty area. It changes img height. This flow
   exists cause there is no scaling of rendered source.
 + (Fixed in 0.5) Windows jumps randomly when dragged when text too width and horizontal offset.
 ? (Not Resolved) Plugin not deal well with deleting large amounts of text when file is too large
 + (Fixed in 0.5) Not always image in the panel is rendered when switching for the first time throught a lot of tabs
 + (Fixed in 0.5) In 10.5 there is no notifyPublisher method in FileEditorManagerEx
 - Visible region draws incorrectly when first and last line visible in editor are both folded
 - Problems when closing tab groups
 - Does not draw column-mode (rectangular) selection correctly
 - Seeking in folding areas (unfold)

IntelliJ IDEA debug note:
-------------------------
 If you want to debug it in runtime, it's recommended to increase PermGen size for
 your debug project to startup or you are able to get unpredictable jvm experience.
 To deal with it use something like this: -Xms2G -Xmx4G -XX:MaxPermSize=2G

 To run IDEA in the sandbox use:
 /usr/java/default/bin/java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=127.0.0.1:49670,suspend=y,server=n
 -Xms2G -Xmx4G -XX:MaxPermSize=2G -Xbootclasspath/a:~/idea-com/idea-IC-108.SNAPSHOT/lib/boot.jar
 -Didea.config.path=~/.IdeaIC11/system/plugins-sandbox/config
 -Didea.system.path=~/.IdeaIC11/system/plugins-sandbox/system
 -Didea.plugins.path=~/.IdeaIC11/system/plugins-sandbox/plugins
 -Didea.platform.prefix=Idea
 -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
 -classpath /usr/java/default/lib/tools.jar:~/idea-com/idea-IC-108.SNAPSHOT/lib/idea_rt.jar:~/idea-com/idea-IC-108.SNAPSHOT/lib/idea.jar:~/idea-com/idea-IC-108.SNAPSHOT/lib/bootstrap.jar:~/idea-com/idea-IC-108.SNAPSHOT/lib/extensions.jar:~/idea-com/idea-IC-108.SNAPSHOT/lib/util.jar:~/idea-com/idea-IC-108.SNAPSHOT/lib/openapi.jar:~/idea-com/idea-IC-108.SNAPSHOT/lib/trove4j.jar:~/idea-com/idea-IC-108.SNAPSHOT/lib/jdom.jar:~/idea-com/idea-IC-108.SNAPSHOT/lib/log4j.jar
 com.intellij.idea.Main
